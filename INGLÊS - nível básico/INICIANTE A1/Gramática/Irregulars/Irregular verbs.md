## 🔄 **Irregular Verbs – Verbos Irregulares em Inglês**

### 📌 **O que são?**

**Verbos irregulares** são aqueles que **não seguem a regra padrão** de conjugação no passado (que normalmente é adicionar **-ed** ao verbo regular).  
Exemplo de verbo regular:

- **work → worked**  
    Já o irregular muda de forma, muitas vezes completamente.

### 🔁 **Três formas principais:**

1. **Base form** (forma base)
    
2. **Simple past** (passado simples)
    
3. **Past participle** (particípio passado)
    

> Usamos o **Simple Past** para ações no passado.  
> Usamos o **Past Participle** com _have / has / had_ (ex: _have gone_, _had seen_).
